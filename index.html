<p>I first dowloaded the background music from Youtbube after making sure that it deos not have copy right restrictions that can be related to this project. Second, I downloaded and installed the Audacity software on my Personal Computer. Using the Audacity, the song was imported and test played. A portion of the song considered relevant for this projetc was selected using the editing tools in the Audacity. Similar actions were done to adjust the time play of the music. The final edition of the music was saved in a designated folder. I then recorded my message and edited it for clarity because the recording contained a loud hiss noise. The song was then imported to the audacity for mixing. Clicking on the solo and mute tools I tested the output of the mix. I used enveloped to tone down the background music. Realizing the abrupt end of the music, I faded the last few seconds. The newly created mix was exported and saved in MP3 format and subsequently saved in my mp3 folder.</p>
